stock price change clustering to understand stock market regime.

# Global credit impulse
pace of the flow of credit in the economy.It tells you whether the credit creation process id accelarating or decelarating.

# The monetary policy stance

The second factor used to determone asset allocation decision is monetary policy stance. To be precise, itâ€™s about the pace of change in relative stance against neutral (r*, see TMC #1) and the pace of change in this stance against consensus expectations.
Where r* is laubach william R star (neutral rate).

Iâ€™d argue we are now firmly in Quadrant 1, where most secular trends resume: long growth vs value, DM vs EM, long fixed income / short inflation break-evens, long gold versus copper etc.

The Fedâ€™s reaction function to hard data and the pace of change in their monetary policy decisions is likely to dictate how often we are going to have quick peeks at Quadrant 4 (sell all risk assets, buy USD and VIX).

Work Done

Unsupervised learning in trading reading the book "Big Data Science in Finance". Plus implementation.

Date 31Dec2021 and 01Jan2022:

Time Series Split on expanding window for random forest , works ok with nifty but poorly with indiividual stocks and also goldbees!!!.

Date 02Jan2022 and 03Jan2022:

Worked on applying unsupervised learning to MMI and Nifty returns.
Worked on a fusion Technical Indicator MACD + Bollinger bands.

Both the folders experiment and experimentation under the technical indicators are important for working with the new model.

Date 04Jan2022 and 05Jan2022:

Work done on unsupervised learning.
Making a cut off of 5% and 2% makes a Kmeans algo work like a nice trend decider.

Date 06Jan2022 till 08Jan2022:

1. Implemented meta-labeling which does ok job , however , the ensemble  method  does better job than meta labeling.
2. Properly Chosen Technical indicators does a much better job than Machine Learning.

Date 11Jan2022 till 12Jan2022:
Created a Algo trading environment in iifl , which is free and also provides historical data for free.
my aws account is also all ready and up and running.
