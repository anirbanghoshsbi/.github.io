stock price change clustering to understand stock market regime.

# Global credit impulse
pace of the flow of credit in the economy.It tells you whether the credit creation process id accelarating or decelarating.

# The monetary policy stance

The second factor used to determone asset allocation decision is monetary policy stance. To be precise, it’s about the pace of change in relative stance against neutral (r*, see TMC #1) and the pace of change in this stance against consensus expectations.
Where r* is laubach william R star (neutral rate).

I’d argue we are now firmly in Quadrant 1, where most secular trends resume: long growth vs value, DM vs EM, long fixed income / short inflation break-evens, long gold versus copper etc.

The Fed’s reaction function to hard data and the pace of change in their monetary policy decisions is likely to dictate how often we are going to have quick peeks at Quadrant 4 (sell all risk assets, buy USD and VIX).
