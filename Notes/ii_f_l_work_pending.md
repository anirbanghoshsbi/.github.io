# First work 
1. update database with the historical data. [ Use csv file].
2. test whether the data-updation is ok or having problems.
# Second Work
1. see whether the app works fine or gets logged out 
2. see whether the orders are properly fed into the system and in the manner it should be.
3. see whether it is what it claims to be and is able to exit position when time comes (!) as I would be trading without stop losses fed before hand.
